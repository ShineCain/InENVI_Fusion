# InENVI_Fusion
Integrating ENvironmental VarIable fusion model for reconstructing NDVI dataset with high spatial and temporal resolution.
InENVI codes provides full cycle of reconstructing NDVI dataset with high spatial and temporal resolution (Li, et al. 2024).

# Instruction
It should be noted that 'InENVI_Radius_Normal.py' is the main code for reconstructing NDVI dataset.
